archigeo.xyz web development specification

main goal of the development:
---
creating a fairly similar site as kozterkep.hu - as a georeferenced architectural database site, with more social features and some ux (user experience) improvements.

the sub-features & graphical design should be similar to pinterest (in many aspects) 




the goal of this specification:
---
Finding the proper (ux based) development team to do the job. while minimizing the effort on the discussion about the details, and the price. 

The process of the discussion: all the participants should provide a shareable & annotatable online mockup, based on kozterkep.hu (inVision is welcomed).
All the participants should get access to all the mockups (viewing & annotating). 

Mobilefirst approach is highly recommended.
